        ECO-14 is a conceptual design of a 14-meter ecological motor yacht with
        electric drive system. She is dedicated to recreational sailing on
        inland and coastal waters. The co-authors of the project are: Marta
        Zawadzka and Juliusz Strawi≈Ñski.

        The "ECO-14" line was created with the thought of sailing in comfortable
        conditions. Thanks to the specially selected electric driving system,
        silent and vibration-free operation of the engine is possible, and the
        lack of exhaust emissions allows reaching the hidden places of the world
        protected by the environment.

        The interior design was made in four different spatial layout
        configurations. Each of the concepts is intended for a suitably defined
        customer:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Private tourist and family yacht for a 4-crew members;</li>
          <li>Charter yacht for a 6-crew members;</li>
          <li>Yacht adapted for the navigation of disabled persons;</li>
          <li>A conference yacht for a crew of 12 people.</li>
      </ol>
    </>
