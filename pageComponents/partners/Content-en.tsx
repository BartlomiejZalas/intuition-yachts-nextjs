        established on 11 May 2006 in Warsaw. The founding members were hundred
        business entities conducting activities in the field of production,
        services, water sports and water tourism. Multi-month efforts of a group

        Association, were successful and resulted in establishment of a superior
        organizational form being the Economic Chamber." Since February 2020,
